# Data Hazards

## How to deal with it?

Must first detect:
1. Introduce stalls (bubbles)
  * Capability to stall instructions and then release when it becomes safe to do so
2. Internal data forwarding
3. Reschedule instructions
  * Static rescheduling - by the compiler
  * Dynamic rescheduling - by the hardware
4. A combination of the above


## How to detect it? - register

### Interlock Control Logic

Compare source registers of instruction in ID to destination register of previous instructions. Should we always stall if the rs field matches some rd? Not every instruction writes a register ‚áí we or reads ‚áí re

### Possible Source & Destination Registers

‚ùìWhat is the purpose of r31?

ü§îTemporary store the PC, and when the instruction wants to jump back, restore it from r31. I think it's for function stack?

## Load & Store Hazards

Detecting the data hazards in memory is much harder!

However, the hazard is avoided because our memory system completes writes in one cycle.

##  HW Change for Forwarding

‚ùìWhy are there two forwarding paths (32 bits each) to both ALU inputs?


ü§îFor two source registers. Either of them will use the output of previous ALU.

---

‚ùìWhy are there two additional paths from MEM/WB?

ü§îI think the upper one is the data from memory and the bottom one is to check whether it is a load instruction or a store instruction.

## Other problems

**Data Hazard Even with Forwarding**

‚ùìCan another forwarding path be added?

ü§îNo.

---

‚ùìWhich instructions can be fixed by forwarding when they follow `lw r1, 5(r3)` in
the given order?

```assembly
add r4,r1,r5 
sub r6,r1,r7 
or r8,r1,r9
```

ü§îThe second one and third one.


We can add a bubble to deal with this kind of situation:

* No dependence
* Dependence requiring stall
* Dependence overcome by forwarding
* Dependence with accesses in order


# Advanced Pipeline Example: MIPS R4000

üëßThey divide the instructions into 8 stages. And please note the "tag check".

# Pipelining with Stalls - calculations

```
CPI_{pipelined} = CPI_{ideal} + Average Stall cycles per Inst

Speedup = Pipeline depth * (Cycle Time_{unpipelined} / Cycle Time_{pipelined}) * (CPI_{ideal} / (CPI_{ideal} + Avg.stall CPI))

For simple RISC pipeline, CPl_{ideal} = 1:

Speedup = (Pipeline depth / (1 + Average stall CPI Cycle Time)) * (Cycle Time_{unpipelined} / Cycle Time_{pipelined}) 

```
