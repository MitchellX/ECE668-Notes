## Dynamic Scheduling: Tomasulo‚Äôs Algorithm

### Background

* For IBM 360/91
* Goal: High Performance without special compilers
* Small number of floating point registers (4 in 360) prevented interesting compiler scheduling of operations
  * This led Tomasulo to try to figure out how to get more effective registers ‚Äî **renaming in hardware!**


* Why Study 1966 Computer?
* The descendants of this have flourished! Alpha 21264, HP 8000, MIPS 10000, Pentium, PowerPC, ...

### Tomasulo Algorithm

* Control & buffers **distributed** with Functional Units (FU)
* FU buffers called ‚Äú**reservation stations**‚Äù; have pending operands
* Registers in instructions replaced by values or pointers to reservation stations (RS);
  * Form of **register renaming**;
  * Avoids WAR, WAW hazards
  * More reservation stations than registers, so can do optimizations compilers can‚Äôt
* Results to FU from RS, **not through registers**, over **Common Data Bus** that broadcasts results to all FUs
* Load and Stores treated as FUs with RSs as well

* The main difference between Tomasulo‚Äôs algorithm and scoreboarding is that the control is distributed vs. the centralized scoreboard control.
* Each FU has its own buffers (for holding a queue of instructions waiting to be executed and their operands) called ‚Äúreservation stations (RS),‚Äù and has its own local control so the overall control is distributed.
* The values of source operands for instructions are stored in the RS rather than kept in the RF and if operand is not yet available, a pointer to the RS that will produce it, is generated.
* A form of ‚Äúregister renaming‚Äù as RS buffers act as RF registers.

* It avoids WAW & WAR as they are due to reuse of registers.
* More RS than registers in the RF ‚Äì can do optimizations that compilers can not as they can only access RF registers.
* Operands from one instruction to another not through RF registers but through a Common Data Bus (CDB).
* The result of an FU is broadcasted over the CDB and all RS monitor the CDB and grab the operand if they need it.
* CDB can be viewed as an extended version of forwarding: in forwarding the source and destination are known, CDB ‚Äì bill board ‚Äì destinations are not known to the sender.
* Load and Store behave similarly with load buffers and store buffers acting like RS.


### Tomasulo‚Äôs Organization

‚ùìDoes the CDB transmit only data?

a. Yes
b. No

ü§îb. No. Some operation results in an address.

### Reservation Station Components

* Op: Operation to perform in the unit (e.g., ADD) 
* Vj, Vk: Value of Source operands
  * Store buffers has Vj field, result to be stored
* Qj, Qk: Reservation stations producing source registers (value to be written)
  * Note: Qj,Qk=0 => ready
* Busy: Indicates reservation station or FU is busy
* Register result status (Rg.Result) ‚Äî Indicates which functional unit will write each register, if one exists. Blank when no pending instructions that will write that register.

‚ùìWhat is the benefit of this?

ü§îbenefit of what?

### Three Phases of Tomasulo‚Äôs Algorithm

1. Issue ‚Äî get instruction from FP Op Queue
   * If reservation station free (no structural hazard), control issues instruction & gets operands (renames registers)
2. Execute‚Äîoperate on operands(EX)
   * When both operands ready then execute; if not ready, watch Common Data Bus for result
3. Write result‚Äîfinish execution (WB)
   * Write on Common Data Bus to all awaiting units; mark reservation station available
   * Normal data bus: data + destination (‚Äúgo to‚Äù bus)
   * Common data bus: data + source (‚Äúcome from‚Äù bus)
     * 64 bits of data + 4 bits of Functional Unit (RS) source address
     * Does the broadcast
     * Other RS get data if ‚Äúsource‚Äù matches the ID of RS that is expected to produce the required operand
   * Example - speed of operations: 2 clocks for Fl.pt.ADD,SUB and LOAD; 10 for MULT; 40 clocks for DIV

### Tomasulo Example

* Same program that we used before
* Register Result Status ‚Äì identical to scoreboard
* RS status ‚Äì similar to FU status in scoreboard but main difference Vj and Vk each have 64 bits
* Instruction status table is not implemented in HW and appears here only for purpose of us understanding what is happening in each cycle.
* Approximate number of bits in an RS: 1+3+64+64+4+4 = 140 bits!
* Assuming here 3 RS in front of FP adder, 2 in front of FP multiplier and 3 load
buffers (no Store instructions in our program)

‚ùìIssue ADDD here despite name dependency on F6?

ü§îI think it's feasible since the register content has already been fetched.

### Drawbacks

* High Complexity (large circuit, high power consumption)
* Many stores (CDB) at high speed resulting limit on performance by Common Data Bus
  * Each CDB must go to multiple functional units =„Äã high wiring density, high capacitance
  * Number of functional units that can complete per cycle limited to one!
    * Multiple CDBs =„Äã more FU logic for parallel stores
    * CDB is the only centralized resource ‚Äì may become a bottleneck;
    * CDB must be connected to all FUs ‚Äì large number of wires with high capacitance ‚Äì slowing down the operation
* Non-precise interrupts!
  * We will address this later
